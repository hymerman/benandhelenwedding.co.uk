<h3 id="why-france">Why France?</h3>
<p>Why the Chateau Javarzay in Chef Boutonne? Well, Ben popped the question whilst we were on holiday in France. But prior to that, this area of France has always been our special escape; we have had numerous holidays in mum and dad's beautiful maison in Saint Martin d'Entraigues. And we love the area. On our holidays, we often pack up a fromage-filled baguette and cycle over to the chateau to picnic by the lake. The area is very special to us, I can't think of anywhere where we feel more relaxed and at home, and we wanted to share it with everyone!</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-the-day">Overview of the day</h3>
<p>We will have our ceremony in the castle grounds (which is a public space, so we may have some curious french onlookers!). We need everyone to keep everything crossed for a beautiful sunny day, but incase anyone brings any English weather with them, we have hired a marquee to shelter under. We are holding the ceremony at 3pm, so would be grateful if you could arrive at about 2:30. After the ceremony we will serve cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and you will have some free time to look around the castle grounds and lake whilst we have photographs taken (for those of you with children, there is a small playpark to keep everyone entertained). Then we will move in the chateau ferme, which literally translates into english as the farm, but don't be alarmed, it is a hall! Here we will have dinner, drinks and dancing into the night!</p>
<h3 id="free-bar">Free bar!!</h3>
<p>As a way of thanking all of you for making the effort of traveling over to France, we have paid for all the drinks at the bar, so you don't need to bring any euros to spend on food or drink on the day of the wedding.</p>
<h3 id="plan-for-the-day-after">Plan for the day after</h3>
<p>Nothing set in stone yet, but we would like to have a gathering and perhaps a BBQ. Details to be confirmed!</p>
<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>
<p>There are many local accommodation options, which we have researched and summarised in the list below. Our advice is to book as local as possible, unless you have a designated driver in your party, because it is not as easy as it is in the UK to catch a taxi! If there are many guests staying in one place or nearby each other, we could try to organise some shared transport.</p>
<h3 id="gites-associated-with-the-chateau-hall-gite-des-fleurs-and-gite-des-arbres">Gites associated with the Chateau hall (Gite des Fleurs and Gite des Arbres)</h3>
<p>We have booked and paid for the accommodation associated with the hall, so it is free to those of you who want it, on a 'first come first served' basis! The accommodation is several dorms, sleeping 4-6 people per room, in bunk beds, and it is available both Saturday night and Sunday night. One of the gites is directly above the hall, and one is next door, approximately 10 steps away! We need you to be out by 10:30 on Monday morning, and you need to leave the bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens in a clean state, else we won't get our deposit back! Bed linen is provided, but that is all. Bathrooms are shared. We had a look round, and everything is very basic but clean and well looked after. We have a total of 36 beds available, so if you would like to use this accommodation, let us know, and we will book you a space and try to organise everyone into groups of people who know each other.</p>
<h3 id="camping-le-moulin">Camping le Moulin</h3>
<p>The campsite has a mixture of pitches for tents, and static caravan homes available for rent, and the site is approximately 1km from the wedding venue. It is run by an English couple, and also has a reasonable restaurant on site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.campingchef.com/campingchef">Camping le Moulin website</a></p>
<h3 id="logis-de-lussais">Logis de Lussais</h3>
<p>Originally built as a manor house with a vineyard, and is now converted into a farmhouse and 4 holiday cottages which sleep 4-8 people each. It is approximately 1.5km away from the wedding venue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.daydreamfrance.com">Logis de Lussais website</a></p>
<h3 id="les-chalets-de-la-héronnière">Les Chalets de la Héronnière</h3>
<p>Recommended to us by our french next-door neighbours Jean-Pierre and Christien. Approximately 2km away from the wedding venue, comprised of 20 chalets around a lake and with an onsite restaurant. It looks quite family-orientated as it also has a playpark.</p>
<p><a href="http://heronniere.com/">Les Chalets de la Héronnière website</a></p>
<h3 id="hotel-des-voyageurs">Hotel des Voyageurs</h3>
<p>located in the centre of Chef Boutonne, approximately 1.5km away from the wedding venue. It has a very nice restaurant downstairs (we recommend the steak, ask for it &quot;à point&quot; for medium, or &quot;saignant&quot; for rare if you are feeling brave!!)</p>

<h3 id="cottage-directly-opposite-chateau-javarzay-information-courtesy-of-our-wedding-planner">Cottage directly opposite Chateau Javarzay (information courtesy of our wedding planner)</h3>
<p>Verina Henchy owns a house opposite the chateau. It is their second home and they don't rent it out commercially. So, they will be there but your guests would have free access to the kitchen, dining room, living room, garden and bikes. There is a double room which is en-suite, a family room with two double beds and a smaller room suitable for one person or two children and a family bathroom. There is also a toilet/shower on the ground floor. The cost for Saturday and Sunday night would be 500€/£400 for the house. She'd be happy to be paid in cash in £'s but would need a 100€ payment as a deposit to her UK bank account. If anyone is interested in this option, please let me know and I will ask for the owner's telephone number.</p>
<h3 id="chateau-ardilleux">Chateau Ardilleux</h3>
<p>Approximately 4km away from the wedding venue, a converted manor house with 5 double ensuite rooms of varying sizes, as well as a detached cottage available to rent. The accommodation includes access to an indoor pool, tennis court and games room. It also has an associated restaurant, with a very tasty looking menu (at the time of writing, one of the desserts is Mango crème brulee!!) www.holidaychateau.com</p>
<h3 id="les-hiboux">Les Hiboux</h3>
<p>Approximately 7km away from the wedding venue, a site containing 4 holiday cottages, each sleeping between 6 and 12 people. On site there is an outdoor pool, boules pitches (very french!) and children's play apparatus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leshiboux.com">Les Hiboux website</a></p>
<h3 id="le-tilleul">Le Tilleul</h3>
<p>Approximately 13km away from the wedding venue, two holiday cottages in the village of Paizay le Tort. Each cottage sleeps 4, and the accommodation is set in grounds containing mature fruit trees where you can help yourself to the produce! They also have an outside pool and games room.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.le-tilleul.com/index1.php">Le Tilleul website</a></p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>Our recommendation is to catch the ferry and drive to the wedding, because if you want to extend your stay you need to have a private vehicle to get around, as public transport is almost non-existent in this rural area of france. Alternatively, fly/train and then hire a car. Driving in France is not as daunting as it sounds - once you have gone around your first roundabout it will feel natural!</p>
<h3 id="by-car">By car</h3>
<p>Remember that in europe you drive on the right-hand side!!!</p>
<p>The most essential piece of kit to remember to fit are the headlight beam adaptors, else your lights will dazzle the locals! It is also law in France to carry several items in your car: GB sticker, warning triangle, fluorescent safety vest and a breathalyser. That being said, all of the times we have been to France we have never carried any of these items, except for the GB sticker. However, that is not the official advice, and if you are stopped and don't have these items you face an on the spot fine.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.rendezvousenfrance.com/en/information/driving-france-0">General advice on driving in France</a></p>
<p>Speed limits are different in France. On their main toll roads, the limits are 130 kph in the dry, and 110 kph in the wet, which is about 80mph and 70mph. The limit in towns is 50kph which is about 30mph.</p>
<p>Speed cameras are different. They are called &quot;control automatique&quot; and are in general not as bright and obvious as british cameras; they try to hide them.</p>
<p>French road etiquette - French drivers are in general not as polite as English drivers! For example, they do not move over to the middle lane of the motorway when you are joining from the slip-road. Some also drive in what english people feel as a threatening manner; very close behind and making it very obvious that they want to overtake. Don't take this personally, this is just how they prefer to drive!</p>
<p>Service stations are called &quot;aire&quot;. Quite often the more rural ones don't have proper toilet, just holes in the ground with a ceramic bit for you to stand on... all part of the authentic french experience!!</p>
<h3 id="by-ferry">By ferry</h3>
<p>Brittany ferries sail from Portsmouth to St Malo, Caen and Le Havre. Condor ferries sail from Portsmouth, Poole and Weymouth to St Malo but you have to change at Guernsey or Jersey. Driving times to Chef Boutonne from St Malo is approx 4-5 hours, from Caen is 4.5-5.5 hours, and from Le Havre is 5-6 hours.</p>
<p>Prices vary a lot depending upon which days you go (midweek is cheaper than weekend), and which crossing you take. Generally it is more expensive to go to St Malo where you have the shorter drive, and cheaper to go to Caen/Le Harve but with a longer drive. So which you choose depends upon what value you put on to the shorter drive!</p>
<p>Many of the main roads in France are toll roads, which you can pay by either cash or card (Carte Bancaire, look for the CB sign on the overhead panels). From St Malo, which is the more expensive ferry, only half the journey is toll roads, but from Caen/Le Havre almost the whole journey is toll roads, so keep this in mind when calculating the costs of alternative options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autoroutes.fr/index.htm?lang=en">Toll road calculator</a></p>
<p>The ferry on the way to France is usually an overnight sailing, and the way back to the UK is during the day. This is how they can sail one boat a day back and forth. On the overnight crossings the ferry companies force you to book some kind of accommodation. The &quot;reclining seat&quot; is the free option, and we always choose this. This means you have the right to choose a seat on the boat, which will be in a lounge of about 50 seats. They are supposed to recline but are usually broken, and unless you are a really good sleeper you won't get any sleep because the rooms are noisy and bright! The alternative is to book a cabin, but these are expensive, so it really depends how much you value your sleep. If you are going for the reclining seat as we usually do, our advice is to take ear plugs, eye mask, blankets, pillow and a sense of humour!</p>
<h3 id="by-plane">By plane</h3>
<p>There are airports at Angoulême, Poitiers, and La Rochelle.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I can't find any direct flights from the UK to Angoulême!</p>
<p>To Poitiers - Ryanair fly from London Stansted, for £30 one-way which takes 1.5hours only, but flight times are limited.</p>
<p>To La Rochelle - Ryanair also flies London Stansted to La Rochelle, similar price and flight time as the Poitiers flight but there seem to be more choice of flight times. Easyjet also fly to La Rochelle, from London Gatwick and Bristol.</p>
<h3 id="by-train">By train</h3>
<p>There are train stations at Ruffec, St Jean d'Angély and Niort.</p>
<p>The main train company is called SNCF which runs trains all over europe, and the high speed trains in France are called TGV.</p>
<p>Direct from Paris to Ruffec takes 2hr19mins, and a return ticket is £36. There are also options to change at Poitiers if you want to visit there on the way.</p>
<p>From Paris to St Jean d'Angély takes 3hr35mins, with a change at Niort, and a return ticket costs £28.50</p>
<p>The best train I can find to Niort is only £16.50! And is direct from Paris, or there are options to change at Poitiers if you would like to visit there. The direct journey takes 2hr29mins.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do</h2>
<p>For those of you planning on spending some more time in the area before/after our wedding, we have compiled a list of activites and places for you to visit</p>
<h3 id="marais-poitevin-poitou-marshes">Marais Poitevin (Poitou marshes)</h3>
<p>This was where we got engaged! It is an area which used to be marshland, but was converted into a maze of canals by farmers. The best thing to do is to hire a canoë or kayak and row your way round. There is also a small village and several small craft-shops in the town as well as places to buy a crêpe. For your satnavs, head to Coulon.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marais_Poitevin">Marais Poitevin on Wikipedia</a></p>
<h3 id="niort">Niort</h3>
<p>The biggest local town, it has a shopping precinct, and a castle, and also a river that you can walk along.</p>
<h3 id="mansle">Mansle</h3>
<p>A town on the river &quot;La Charente&quot;, perfect for a dip in the river (Ben's preference), or just relaxing by the side (Helen's preference).</p>
<h3 id="la-rochelle">La Rochelle</h3>
<p>The nearest sea-side town. It has a bustling town centre with many (expensive) shops and lots of tourists. There is always something going on! It is a good place to visit if you wish to sample some &quot;fruits de mer&quot;, but equally you can find many tasty crêpes if you don't like seafood. You can also take boat trips to Fort Boyard. There are also two islands to visit - Île de Ré and Île d'Oléron.</p>
<h3 id="melle">Melle</h3>
<p>A pretty local village, with churches to look round, and the &quot;Mines d'argent&quot; which are the oldest silver mines in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.visit-poitou-charentes.com/Visites/Mines-d-Argent-des-Rois-Francs">Melle silver mine information</a></p>
<h2 id="eating-out">Eating out</h2>
<p>Again, for those of you planning on extending your stay, we have compiled a list of local eateries. Be aware that restaurants are only open on certain days, in particular most places seem to be closed on Sunday and Monday nights.</p>
<h3 id="la-mine-dor-brioux-sur-boutonne">La Mine d'Or, Brioux-sur-Boutonne</h3>
<p>Our favourite restaurant! Very reasonably priced, run by a husband and wife team. They serve a cold buffet starter, followed by a main, cheese course and pudding, for €16.50. One word of warning; you absolutely have to book your table, and the owner will tell you the time she wants you to arrive, normally &quot;sept heure et demi&quot; (7:30). We have witnessed her turning people away if they haven't booked, even though we were the only other customers in the restaurant!</p>
<h3 id="hotel-des-voyageurs-chef-boutonne">Hotel des Voyageurs, Chef Boutonne</h3>
<p>A bit more pricey, but excellent food. In the nice weather they serve food on their outside terrace. Last time we visited I had a particularly tasty steak!</p>
<h3 id="pizzeria-restaurant-jos-chef-boutonne">Pizzeria Restaurant JOS, Chef Boutonne</h3>
<p>Recently renovated, they sell tasty pizza. We usually get a takeaway &quot;pour emporter&quot;</p>
<h3 id="restaurant-des-canards-chef-boutonne">Restaurant des Canards, Chef Boutonne</h3>
<p>This is the restaurant associated with the camp site. It is run by an English couple, but the last time we went the chef was french. They tend to serve more english-y meals, because most of their customers at the campsite are English. They also have themed nights e.g. quiz nights on specific days of the week, which they advertise on the board outside the campsite.</p>
<h3 id="la-côte-de-boeuf-melle">La Côte de Boeuf, Melle</h3>
<p>Best place to get a steak! Bear in mind that the french range of well-done to rare is not the same as the English range!!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lacotedeboeuf.fr/">La Côte de Boeuf website</a></p>
<h2 id="gifts">Gifts</h2>
<p>We don't want people to buy us gifts, as we feel that it is enough to ask you to travel all the way over to France! And we do honestly mean that.</p>
<p>However, we understand that some guests may still insist on something, so we intend to show you our minimoon/honeymoon plans, and allow you to pay for some part e.g. our overnight stay in the &quot;chateau dans les arbres&quot;, so that we can think of you at that particular event and when we return we can thank you personally for a particular part of the trip. Further details to follow!</p>
<h2 id="discuss">Discuss</h2>
<p>We would like you to use this area as an open discussion, for people to organise sharing accommodation and travel with each other. It would be great if you could post your travel plans even if you are not intending on sharing, as perhaps we can organise a coach or something along those lines if enough people are catching the same flight. Alternatively, perhaps people would like to share the cost of a hire car? Also, please use this area to let us know if you are interested in the accommodation associated with the hall, because we will try to organise you into the best groups possible, so that people who know each other are sharing together etc.</p>
